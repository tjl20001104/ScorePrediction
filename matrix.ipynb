    "### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Rating prediction. Use the data in `train_ratings.csv` to construct a model. Then predict the ratings of (user, book) pair in `test_rating.csv`. Finally, the RMSE of the predicted rating and the ground truth rating is calculated\n",

    "### Requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use RMSE of predicted rating as metric. Other reasonable metrics are welcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We encourge you to implement 2 methods. 1) The algorithm in this course. 2) Use deep models and combines the techniques of this course.\n",
